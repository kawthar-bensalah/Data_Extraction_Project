# Data_Extraction_Project

Java Application to extract data from reference website.

## Description

* The project in four steps :  
1 - Generate a dictionary of medical entities by active substance from a medical website placed on the Apache server.  
2 - Apply these dictionaries to a medical corpus composed of patient documents, in order to extract all occurrences of medical entities by active substance.  
3 - The result of this extraction will be displayed in an HTML page and stored in a MySQL database.  
4 - Enrich the previously generated dictionary with new medical entities from the medical corpus.     

* The aspiration of the html code is carried out by the use of JAVA programming language and the "URL" (aspiration) class. This class provides a high-level interface to access Web informations from the URLs. The extraction will be done locally on the "EasyPHP" web development platform's web server, starting from a directory called "vidal" containing 26 HTML pages, which will be generated from the Vidal web site.
